##Design Justification We have three rooms in an escape room. The office, bedroom, and bathroom. All are connected and the user can travel to any room in the beginning and after they complete the one they choose they can go to either of the two rooms aftwerwards. We chose this so the user can have more freedom in the direction of the game. An alternative design was to have the user go to rooms in a chronological order.

Additional Reflection Questions
What was your overall approach to tackling this project? 
We knew the concept of our game but we didn't know how we would start to code it. At first we drew a architecture diagram to plan out what our parent classes and subclasses if needed would contain as well as how our classes would connect to each other. We would code what we had envisioned and continue to make revisions if we thought of something new or if something didn't work out or make sense in the end. We had to do a lot of trial and error with our code and see what worked. There were constantly changes being made.

What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project? 
One thing we learned was the map interface within Java so we could have the user go to the different rooms within the game. We learned to do a gameloop in order to connect all of our Room classes together to make a functional game. We also created a wToContinue command to get the user to interact and to continue to each new part of the game.

Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently? 
We wish we would implemented the subclasses differently so it made putting everything together in the end much  smoother.

If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement? 
We would make the rooms much more complex for the user to escape from. For example, putting multiple clues in the rooms and having them be connected to the point you can't understand one clue without having another. We would've probably made it so it was a more complex map as well so that you had to go to certain rooms before you could finish the game. 

What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you? 
The most helpful piece of feedback was to use a lot of pseudo code to plan out our next steps and that was given by our professor. It really helped us envision what we wanted to do and what steps we needed to take in order to get there.

If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give? 
Don't get intimadated by all the errors as that is normal for writing code. Hints I would give is to comment out that code and work on something else so that when you come back you will have a fresh pair of eyes and can find the error. Collaborating can also help with finding different ways to code something.

If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project. 
Our team dynamics made the experience working on this project much more easier. We were able to split the work evenly and made sure to communicate what we were working on so we both didn't end up working on the exact same thing. We were also able to create a more complex game because there was another person working on it. It was also nice to have someone to collaborate with to help understand any issues and to work through them.
